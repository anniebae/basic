Annie BASIC 1.0 12/13/2014

=====================================
BASIC is an app to see how basic of a person you are based on your Instagram.

More specifically, when a user signs up to be a part of the BASIC community, s/he must enter their real Instagram account name (The reasoning behind using Instagram is because all basic bitches have an IG. So if you don't have IG, then you're not basic to begin with).

On a user's initial sign up, a survey will be provided as an initiation process of entering the community. Depending on how a user answers the questions, BASIC will add up points from the survey. Additionally, BASIC will parse through a user's 20 most recent posts and look for key words that are considered "basic". Those words will be given a certain amount of points and added to the survey points. The total score will be shown on the scoreboard, where a user can see where they rank compared to others (rank 1 being the most basic).

=====================================
If a user is already part of the BASIC community, s/he can simply log in to see their Profile and the Basic Scoreboard. The ranks on the scoreboard will change depending on how consistent a user is with Instagram and uses certain "basic" words.

In case one does not know what "basic" means, there is an "Educate Yourself" section in the navbar which provides a bunch of resources to clarify the meaning of a "basic bitch."
